    The experts predicted networked artificial intelligence will amplify human effectiveness but also threaten human
    autonomy, agency and capabilities. They spoke of the wide-ranging possibilities; that computers might match or
    even exceed human intelligence and capabilities on tasks such as complex decision-making, reasoning and
    learning, sophisticated analytics and pattern recognition, visual acuity, speech recognition and language
    translation. They said “smart” systems in communities, in vehicles, in buildings and utilities, on farms and in
    business processes will save time, money and lives and offer opportunities for individuals to enjoy a
    more-customized future.
